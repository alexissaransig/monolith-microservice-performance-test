## Basic Node.js Server

This is an example of a basic monolithic node.js service that has been designed to run directly on a server, without a container.

### Architecture

Since Node.js programs run a single threaded event loop it is necessary to use the node `cluster` functionality in order to get maximum usage out of a multi-core server.
